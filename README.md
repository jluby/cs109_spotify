The guiding question for this final project has been: __what characteristics are most associated with the popularity of a song as compared to the popularity of the album across a large range of music?__

It is interesting to explore this question with songs across different genres to see if there are some underlying similarities about the characteristics of songs that stand out from their album. This would be perhaps revelatory of an underlying truth of music in this age, or of how people use Spotify as a platform.

Initially, the hypothesis was founded in a common understanding of the top 100 chart, and the music many perceive to be popular. This music generally strikes one as upbeat, fast-tempo, and happy. Yet, while these factors seemed to be related to absolute popularity, it hasn't yet been studied if these were also factors that made a song stand out within its album.

Using the Spotify API, the study leveraged the characteristics that Spotify uses to classify its music. Among these features, it was assumed that tempo, danceability and energy were going to be the most significantly associated with comparative popularity.

Now, with linear modeling, kNN regression, random forest modeling, and artificial neural networks, predictive models were built to more concretely investigate these associations.
